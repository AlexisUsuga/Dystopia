Thank you for using "Nominal 5"Use this font at 8pt (or multiples of - 16,24,32,40,etc) with anti-aliasing and fractional width turned off.The current version will not work well in Macromedia Flash.Contact me if you need it for Flash and I'll get off my lazy behind and put the extra muscle into it.Direct any questions or comments to Ben Husmann, ben@bellhop2000.com
